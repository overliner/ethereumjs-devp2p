## [3.0.3] - 2020-09-29

- Moved `TypeScript` type packages for `lru-cache` and `bl` from `devDependencies` to
  `dependencies`, PR [#90](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/90)

[3.0.3]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3

## [3.0.2] - 2020-09-28

- Fixed `TypeScript` import issue causing problems when integrating the library in a
  `TypeScript` project, PR [#88](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/88)
- Updated `k-bucket` library to `v5`, added types from new `@types/k-bucket` package from
  @tomonari-t, PR [#88](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/88)

[3.0.2]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2

## [3.0.1] - 2020-06-10

This release focuses on improving the [debugging](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p#debugging)
capabilities of the library. PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/72)
reduces the **verbosity** of the log output to cut on noise on everyday debugging. There is a new `verbose`
logger to retain the more verbose output (e.g. with full message bodies) which can be used like this:

```shell
DEBUG=devp2p:*,verbose node -r ts-node/register ./examples/peer-communication.ts
```

**Other Logging Improvements**

Relevant PRs [#75](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/75) and
[#73](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/73):

- Added number of peers to `refillConnections()` debug message
- Replaced try/catch logic for EIP-8 auth check to avoid side-effects and get rid of misleading _wrong-ecies-header_ debug output
- Moved debug output in `BanList.add()` after the set operation to get the correct size output
- Added debug message for `DISCONNECT` reason from peer (this was always some constant re-debug reason, and at the end it's mostly `TOO_MANY_PEERS`)
- Internalize detached logger output from the `devp2p:util` logger

**Other Changes**

- Refactored `Peer` class for better code readability, PR [#77](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/77)

There has also been a new [high-level diagram](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p#api) added to the `README` which can be used to get an overview on the structure, available loggers and the event flow of the library (PR [#76](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/76)).

[3.0.1]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1

## [3.0.0] - 2020-05-25

First `TypeScript` release of the library, see PR [#56](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/56) for all the changes and associated discussion.

All source parts of the library have been ported to `TypeScript` and working with the library should now therefore be much more reliable due to the additional type safety features provided by the `TypeScript` language. The API of the library remains unchanged in a `JavaScript` context.

**Noteworthy Changes from PR [#56](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/pull/56):**

- Type additions for all method signatures and class members of all protocol components (`dpt`, `eth`, `les`, `rlpx`)
- Addition of various structuring interfaces (like [PeerInfo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/blob/master/src/dpt/message.ts#L10) for `DPT` message input) and `enum` constructs (like [MESSAGE_CODES](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/blob/master/src/eth/index.ts#L186) from the `ETH` protocol)
- Port of the [examples](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/tree/master/examples) to `TypeScript`
- Port of all the [test cases](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-devp2p/tree/master/test) to `TypeScript`
- Integration of the library into the common [ethereumjs-config](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-config) EthereumJS configuration setup (`standard` -> `TSLint` linting, docs with `TypeDoc`, `TypeScript` compilation, `Prettier` formatting rules)
- Lots of code cleanups and code part modernizations

Thanks @dryajov for all the great work on this! ‚ù§
